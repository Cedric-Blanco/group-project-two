## Design Notes

We are aiming to create an e-commerce platform capable of showcasing products and
allowing users to create accounts, log in, shop for products, add them to their carts, and check
out.

The theme we are going for is minimalistic, stylish, and designed around ease of use to
maximize user retention. The products will be displayed in an attractive way and images within
product cards will enlarge when hovered over to make the page feel more interactive. We are
aiming for a dark themed background, and simple sans serif font to make the page easy on the
eyes and easy to read.

The various functionality elements will be developed incrementally in modular fashion. This will
allow our team to maximize our individual efforts.
